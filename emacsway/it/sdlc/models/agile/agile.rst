    üí¨ "Agile development - software development approach based on :ref:`iterative <emacsway-iterative-development>` development, frequent inspection and :ref:`adaptation <emacsway-adaptation>`, and :ref:`incremental <emacsway-incremental-development>` deliveries, in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration in cross‚Äêfunctional teams and through continual stakeholder feedback."

    -- "ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 Systems and software engineering - Software life cycle processes"

..

    üí¨ "Scrum is, as the reader supposedly knows, an agile method.
    The agile family of development methods evolved from the old and well-known :ref:`iterative <emacsway-iterative-development>` and :ref:`incremental <emacsway-incremental-development>` life-cycle approaches.
    They were born out of a belief that an approach more grounded in human reality ‚Äì and the product development reality of learning, innovation, and change ‚Äì would yield better results."

    -- "Jeff Sutherland's Scrum Handbook" by Jeff Sutherland

..

    üí¨ "\"Agile\" methods actually can be applied within a variety of models.
    While Agile methods are common in executing an evolutionary lifecycle model, they can be used in other lifecycle models at various stages.
    What the methods have in common is an emphasis on continuous inspection and collaboration in the rapid production of working software in an environment where changes, including changes to requirements, are expected."

    -- "ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 Systems and software engineering - Software life cycle processes"

..

    üí¨ "As discussed in 5.4.2, the life cycle models used in agile projects are often highly :ref:`incremental <emacsway-incremental-development>` and :ref:`evolutionary <emacsway-evolutionary-development>`."

    -- "ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 Systems and software engineering - Software life cycle processes"

..

    üí¨ "Unlike Waterfall, Agile emphasizes iterative development, or building software in pieces.
    Agile teams typically work in short cycles‚Äîwhich are called \"sprints\" in Scrum, today one of the most widely used forms of Agile‚Äîthat usually last two weeks each."

    -- "`The Winter Getaway That Turned the Software World Upside Down <https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/12/agile-manifesto-a-history/547715/>`__" by Caroline Mimbs Nyce

..

    üí¨ "Certainly agile processes require an iterative approach and cannot work in a waterfall style."

    üí¨ "WaterFall is based on the empirical observation of 30 years ago (ref: BarryBoehm, Software Engineering Economics, Prentice Hall, 1981.) that the cost of change rises exponentially (base 10) by phases. The conclusion is that you should make the big decisions up front, because changing them is so expensive."

    üí¨ "What would we do if all that investment paid off?
    What if all that work on languages and databases and whatnot actually got somewhere?
    What if the cost of change didn't rise exponentially overtime, but rose much more slowly, **eventually reaching an asymptote**?
    What if tomorrow's software engineering professor draws Figure 3 on the board?"

    üí¨ "For example, I think that ultimately, Extreme Programming has mushroomed in use and interest, not because of pair-programming or refactoring, but because, taken as a whole, the practices define a developer community freed from the baggage of Dilbertesque corporations.
    Kent Beck tells the story of an early job in which he estimated a programming effort of six weeks for two people.
    After his manager reassigned the other programmer at the beginning of the project, he completed the project in twelve weeks‚Äîand felt terrible about himself!
    The boss‚Äîof course‚Äîharangued Kent about how slow he was throughout the second six weeks.
    Kent, somewhat despondent because he was such a \"failure\" as a programmer, finally realized that his original estimate of 6 weeks was extremely accurate‚Äîfor 2 people‚Äîand that his \"failure\" was really the manager's failure, indeed, the failure of the standard \"fixed\" process mindset that so frequently plagues our industry.

    This type of situation goes on every day‚Äîmarketing, or management, or external customers, internal customers, and, yes, even developers ‚Äî don't want to make hard trade-off decisions, so they impose irrational demands through the imposition of corporate power structures.
    This isn't merely a software development problem, it runs throughout Dilbertesque organizations.

    In order to succeed in the new economy, to move aggressively into the era of e-business, e-commerce, and the web, companies have to rid themselves of their Dilbert manifestations of make-work and arcane policies.
    This freedom from the inanities of corporate life attracts proponents of Agile Methodologies, and scares the begeebers (you can't use the word 'shit' in a professional paper) out of traditionalists.
    Quite frankly, the Agile approaches scare corporate bureaucrats ‚Äî at least those that are happy pushing process for process' sake versus trying to do the best for the \"customer\" and deliver something timely and tangible and \"as promised\" ‚Äî because they run out of places to hide.

    The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact, many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology.
    We want to restore a balance. We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository.
    We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment.
    Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as \"hackers\" are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker."

    üí¨ "**Customer Bill of Rights**

    - You have the right to an overall plan, to know what can be accomplished when and at what cost.
    - You have the right to get the most possible value out of every programming week.
    - You have the right to see progress in a running system, proven to work by passing repeatable tests that you specify.
    - You have the right to change your mind, to substitute functionality, and to change priorities without paying exorbitant costs.
    - You have the right to be informed of schedule changes, in time to choose how to reduce the scope to restore the original date. You can cancel at any time and be left with a useful working system reflecting investment to date.

    **Programmer Bill of Rights**

    - You have the right to know what is needed, with clear declarations of priority.
    - You have the right to produce quality work at all times.
    - You have the right to ask for and receive help from peers, managers, and customers.
    - You have the right to make and update your own estimates.
    - You have the right to accept your responsibilities instead of having them assigned to you."

    üí¨ "Software development is risky. People involved have many fears of what may go wrong.

    To develop effectively we must acknowledge these fears. Why do we need a software process? For the same reason that we need laws, governments, and taxes: fear.

    The Declaration of Independence says:

        That among these [rights] are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

    Though the profundity of these words may distract us, consider the word secure. We institute governments because we are afraid of losing our rights. By the same token, we institute software processes because we are afraid.

    **Customers are afraid that**

    - They won't get what they asked for.
    - They'll ask for the wrong thing.
    - They'll pay too much for too little.
    - They must surrender control of their career to techies who don't care.
    - They won't ever see a meaningful plan.
    - The plans they do see will be fairy tales.
    - They won't know what's going on.
    - They'll be held to their first decisions and won't be able to react to changes in the business.
    - No one will tell them the truth.

    **Developers are afraid, too. They fear that**

    - They will be told to do more than they know how to do.
    - They will be told to do things that don't make sense.
    - They are too stupid.
    - They are falling behind technically.
    - They will be given responsibility without authority.
    - They won't be given clear definitions of what needs to be done.
    - They'll have to sacrifice quality for deadlines.
    - They'll have to solve hard problems without help.
    - They won't have enough time to succeed."

    üí¨ "At the core of understanding this argument is the software change curve.
    The change curve says that as the project runs, it becomes exponentially more expensive to make changes.
    The change curve is usually expressed in terms of phases \"a change made in analysis for $1 would cost thousands to fix in production\".
    This is ironic as most projects still work in an ad-hoc process that doesn't have an analysis phase, but the exponentiation is still there.
    **The exponential change curve means that evolutionary design cannot possibly work.**
    It also conveys why planned design must be done carefully because any mistakes in planned design face the same exponentiation.

    **The fundamental assumption underlying XP is that it is possible to flatten the change curve enough to make evolutionary design work.**
    This flattening is both enabled by XP and exploited by XP.
    This is part of the coupling of the XP practices: specifically **you can't do those parts of XP that exploit the flattened curve without doing those things that enable the flattening.**
    This is a common source of the controversy over XP.
    Many people criticize the exploitation without understanding the enabling.
    Often the criticisms stem from critics' own experience where they didn't do the enabling practices that allow the exploiting practices to work.
    As a result they got burned and when they see XP they remember the fire."

    **This is one of the premises of XP. It is the technical premise of XP.**
    If the cost of change rose slowly over time, you would act completely differently from how you do under the assumption that costs rise exponentially.
    You would make big decisions as late in the process as possible, to defer the cost of making the decisions and to have the greatest possible chance that they would be right.
    You would only implement what you had to, in hopes that the needs you anticipate for tomorrow wouldn't come true.
    You would introduce elements to the design only as they simplified existing code or made writing the next bit of code simpler.

    **If a flattened change cost curve makes XP possible, a steep change cost curve makes XP impossible.**
    If change is ruinously expensive, you would be crazy to charge ahead without careful forethought.
    But if change stays cheap, the additional value and reduced risk of early concrete feedback outweighs the additional cost of early change."

    üí¨ "One pattern I see time and time again on software teams is that they adopt Scrum, pay little attention to technical practices, and they're able to consistently increase their velocity for the first few years.
    But after about three or four years the technical debt they've accumulated in their code is so great that their velocity starts to grind to a halt and they find it difficult to even get simple features implemented.
    This is a place you do not want to get to, though I see it far too often in the software community‚Äîteams stuck there without a clue how to get out."

    I learned from Jeff Sutherland that the first Scrum actually did all the XP practices.
    But Ken Schwaber convinced him to leave the engineering practices out of Scrum, to keep the model simple and let the teams take responsibility for the tech practices themselves.
    Perhaps this helped spread Scrum faster, but the downside is that a lot of teams suffer because they lack the technical practices that enable sustainable agile development."

    üí¨ "To make agile work, you need solid technical practices.
    A lot of agile education under-emphasizes these, but if you skimp on this you won't gain the productivity and responsiveness benefits that agile development can give you (stranding you at level 1 of the agile fluency model.)

    üí¨ "In its common usage, evolutionary design is a disaster.
    The design ends up being the aggregation of a bunch of ad-hoc tactical decisions, each of which makes the code harder to alter.
    In many ways you might argue this is no design, certainly it usually leads to a poor design.
    As Kent puts it, **design is there to enable you to keep changing the software easily in the long term.**
    **As design deteriorates, so does your ability to make changes effectively.**
    You have the state of software entropy, over time the design gets worse and worse.
    Not only does this make the software harder to change, it also makes bugs both easier to breed and harder to find and safely kill.
    This is the "code and fix" nightmare, where the bugs become exponentially more expensive to fix as the project goes on."

    üí¨ "Grady Booch has also provided a set of guidelines for an agile architecture (which in turn imply some duties for the agile architect).
    Booch claims that all good software-intensive architectures are agile.
    What does he mean by this? He means that a successful architecture is resilient and loosely coupled.
    It is composed of a core set of well-reasoned design decisions but still contains some \"wiggle room\" that allows modifications to be made and refactorings to be done, without ruining the original structure.

    Booch also notes that an effective agile process will allow the architecture to grow incrementally as the system is developed and matures.
    The key to success is to have decomposability, separation of concerns, and near-independence of the parts.
    (Sound familiar? These are all modifiability tactics.)

    Finally, Booch notes that to be agile, the architecture should be visible and self-evident in the code; this means making the design patterns, cross-cutting concerns, and other important decisions obvious, well communicated, and defended.
    This may, in turn, require documentation.
    But whatever architectural decisions are made, the architect must make an effort to \"socialize\" the architecture."
