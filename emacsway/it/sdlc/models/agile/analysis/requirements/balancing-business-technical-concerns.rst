    One key to our strategy is to keep technical people focused on technical problems and business people focused on business problems.
    The project must be driven by business decisions, but the business decisions must be informed by technical decisions about cost and risk.

    There are two common failure modes in the relationship between Business and Development.
    **If either Business or Development gains too much power, the project suffers.**"

    When Development is in charge, they put in place all the process and technology that they never had time for when "those suits" were pushing them around.
    They install new tools, new languages, new technologies.
    And the tools, languages, and technologies are chosen because they are interesting and cutting edge.
    Cutting edge implies risk.
    (If we haven't learned that by now, when will we?)

    So, the net result of the "Development in Charge" scenario is too much effort and way, way **too much risk for too little return**."

    There are many examples from other arts and crafts that lead one to believe that discipline is good for art.
    Indeed, an artist's aphorism asserts, "Form is liberating."
    The worst buildings are those whose budget was too great for the purposes to be served.
    Bach's creative output hardly seems to have been squelched by the necessity of producing a limited-form cantata each week.
    I am sure that the Stretch computer would have had a better architecture had it been more tightly constrained; the constraints imposed by the System/360 Model 30's budget were in my opinion entirely beneficial for the Model 75's architecture.

    Similarly, I observe that the external provision of an architecture enhances, not cramps, the creative style of an implementing group.
    They focus at once on the part of the problem no one has addressed, and inventions begin to flow.
    In an unconstrained implementing group, most thought and debate goes into architectural decisions, and implementation proper gets short shrift. [5]"

    If Business has the power, they feel fit to dictate all four variables to Development.
    "Here is what you will do.
    Here is when it will be done.
    No, you can't have any new workstations.
    And it better be of the highest quality or you're in trouble, buster."

    In this scenario, Business always specifies too much.
    Some of the items on the list of requirements are absolutely essential.
    But some are not.
    And if Development doesn't have any power, they can't object; they can't force Business to choose which is which.
    So Development dutifully goes to work, heads down, on the impossible task they have been given.

    It seems to be in the nature of the less important requirements that they entail the greatest risk.
    They are typically the poorest understood, so there is great risk that the requirements will change all during development.
    Somehow, they also tend to be technically riskier.

    **The result of the "Business in Charge" scenario, then, is that the project takes on too much effort and way, way too much risk for :ref:too little return** <emacsway-agile-development-difficulties>`."

    What to Do?

    The solution is to somehow **split the responsibility and power between Business and Development**.
    **Business people should make the decisions for which they are suited.**
    **Programmers should make the decisions for which they are suited.**
    Each party's decisions should inform the other's.
    Neither party should be able to unilaterally decide anything."

    Here is a model of software development from the perspective of a system of control variables.
    In this model, there are four variables in software development:

    - Cost
    - Time
    - Quality
    - Scope

    The way the software development game is played in this model is that **external forces (customers, managers) get to pick the values of any three of the variables**.
    **The development team gets to pick the resultant value of the fourth variable.**

    Some managers and customers believe they can pick the value of all four variables.
    "You are going to get all these requirements done by the first of next month with exactly this team.
    And quality is job one here, so it will be up to our usual standards."
    When this happens, :ref:`quality always goes out the window <emacsway-agile-development-difficulties>` (this is generally up to the usual standards, though), since nobody does good work under too much stress.
    Also likely to go out of control is time.
    You get crappy software late.

    The solution is to make the four variables visible.
    If everyone‚Äîprogrammers, customers, and managers‚Äîcan see all four variables, they can consciously choose which variables to control.
    If they don't like the result implied for the fourth variable, they can change the inputs, or they can pick a different three variables to control."

    üìù "Quality

    Sacrificing quality is not effective as a means of control.
    **Quality is not a control variable.**
    Projects don't go faster by accepting lower quality.
    They don't go slower by demanding higher quality.
    Pushing quality higher often results in faster delivery; while lowering quality standards often results in later, less predictable delivery.

    One of my biggest surprises since the first edition of Extreme Programming Explained was released has been just how far teams have been able to push quality as measured in defects, design quality, and the experience of development.
    Each increase in quality leads to improvements in other desirable project properties, like productivity and effectiveness, as well.
    There is no apparent limit to the benefits of quality, only limits in our ability to understand how to achieve higher quality.

    Quality isn't a purely economic factor.
    People need to do work they are proud of.
    I remember talking to the manager of a mediocre team.
    He went home on the weekends and made fancy ironwork as a blacksmith.
    He met his need for quality; he just met it outside of work.

    If you can't control projects by controlling quality, how can you control them?
    Time and cost are most often fixed.
    XP chooses scope as the primary means of planning, tracking, and steering projects.
    Since scope is never known precisely in advance, it makes a good lever.
    The weekly and quarterly cycles provide explicit points for tracking and choosing scope.

    A concern for quality is no excuse for inaction.
    If you don't know a clean way to do a job that has to be done, do it the best way you can.
    If you know a clean way but it would take too long, do the job as well as you have time for now.
    Resolve to finish doing it the clean way later.
    This often occurs during architectural evolution, where you have to live with two architectures solving the same problem while you transition from one to the other.
    Then the transition itself becomes a demonstration of quality: making a big change efficiently in small, safe steps."

Jeffrey Sutherland –æ —Ç–æ–º, –∫–∞–∫ –∏ –∑–∞—á–µ–º –æ–Ω –≤–≤–µ–ª —Ä–æ–ª—å Product Owner:

    üìù "When I started the first Scrum team in 1993, I didn't have a Product Owner.
    I was part of the leadership team and had a bunch of other responsibilities besides figuring out exactly what the team should do in each Sprint.
    I carried out management and marketing duties, dealt with customers, and plotted strategy.
    But in that first Sprint I figured I could handle the Backlog.
    I just needed to make sure I had enough "stories" and features for the team to work on during the next Sprint.
    The problem was, after the second Sprint we introduced the Daily Stand-up meeting.
    Velocity went up 400 percent in the next Sprint, and the team finished in a week what we thought would take us a month.
    There was no more Backlog for them to work on! I thought I'd have a month to create more "stories." A great problem to have, admittedly, but one that had to be addressed.
    So I thought about this role of Product Owner and what qualities someone would need to execute it properly.

    My inspiration for the role came from Toyota's Chief Engineer.
    A Chief Engineer at Toyota is responsible for a whole product line, such as the Corolla or the Camry.
    To do this, they have to draw on the talents of groups specializing in body engineering, or chassis, or electrical, or whatever.
    The Chief Engineer has to draw from all those groups to create a cross-functional team capable of creating a car.
    Outside of Toyota everyone thinks of these legendary Chief Engineers (or Shusas, as they were originally called) as all-powerful leaders of the "Toyota Way." And in a way they are.
    But what they don't have is authority.
    No one reports to them‚Äîrather, they report to their own groups.
    People can tell Chief Engineers that they're wrong, so they have to make sure they're right.
    They don't give anyone performance appraisals or promotions or raises.
    But they do decide on the vision of the car, and how the car will be made‚Äîby persuasion, not coercion.

    It's this idea that I wanted to embody within Scrum.
    John Shook of the Lean Enterprise Institute once began his description of the Chief Engineer role by quoting the US Marine Corps leadership manual:

    "An individual's responsibility for leadership is not dependent on authority.‚Ä¶ the deep-rooted assumption that authority should equal responsibility is the root of much organizational evil.
    I believe misunderstanding around this issue is rampant, problematic, and runs so deep in our consciousness that we don't even realize it." [Shook, John. "The Remarkable Chief Engineer." Lean Enterprise Institute, February 3, 2009]

    Reflecting on my time at West Point and in Vietnam, I found myself agreeing that leadership has nothing to do with authority.
    Rather, it has to do with‚Äîamong other things‚Äîknowledge and being a servant-leader.
    The Chief Engineer can't simply say something has to be done a particular way.
    He has to persuade, cajole, and demonstrate that his way is the right way, the best way.
    It usually takes someone with thirty years of experience to fill the role.
    I wanted that in Scrum, but I'm also well aware that very few people have that level of skill and experience.
    So I split the role in two, giving the Scrum Master the how and the Product Owner the what.

    Even in those early days of Scrum I knew that I needed someone who was deeply connected to the customer.
    The Product Owner needed to be able to deliver feedback to the team from the customer each and every Sprint.
    They needed to spend half their time talking to the people buying the product (getting their thoughts on the latest incremental release and how it delivered value) and half their time with the team creating the Backlog (showing them what the customers valued and what they didn't)."
