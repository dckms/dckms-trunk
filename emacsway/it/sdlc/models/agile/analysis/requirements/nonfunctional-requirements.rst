    üìù "**Nonfunctional requirements need to have priority alongside user stories; you can‚Äôt defer their implementation until a later iteration.**
    It‚Äôs possible to specify quality attributes in the form of stories: "As a help desk technician, I want the knowledge base to respond to queries **within five seconds** so the customer doesn‚Äôt get frustrated and hang up."

    <...>

    Developers need to keep nonfunctional requirements in mind as they consider the implications of implementing individual user stories.
    As more functionality is added through a series of iterations, the system‚Äôs efficiency and hence performance can deteriorate.
    Specify performance goals and begin performance testing **with early iterations**, so you can become aware of concerns early enough to take corrective actions.

    <...>

    As with user stories, it‚Äôs possible to write acceptance tests for quality attributes.
    This is a way to quantify the quality attributes.
    If a performance goal is stated simply as ‚ÄúThe knowledge base must return search results quickly,‚Äù you can‚Äôt write tests to define what constitutes ‚Äúquickly.‚Äù A better acceptance test would be: "Keyword search of the knowledge base **takes less than 5 seconds**, and preferably **less than 3 seconds**, to return a result.

    <...>

    Part of **accepting an iteration as being complete** is to assess whether the pertinent nonfunctional requirements are satisfied.
    Often there is a range of acceptable performance, with some outcomes more desirable than others.
    As it does for any other software development approach, satisfying quality requirements can distinguish delight from disappointment on agile projects."

    System Architect/Engineering is an individual or team that defines the overall architecture of the system. They work at a level of abstraction above the teams and components and define Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), major system elements, subsystems, and interfaces.

    üìù "The **product owner is responsible** for defining the acceptance criteria for each product backlog item.
    These are the conditions under which the product owner would be satisfied that the functional and **nonfunctional requirements** have been met.
    The product owner may also write acceptance tests corresponding to the acceptance criteria, or he could enlist the assistance of subject matter experts (SMEs) or development team members.
    In either case, the product owner should ensure that these acceptance criteria (and frequently specific acceptance tests) are created before an item is considered at a sprint-planning meeting.
    Without them, the team would have an incomplete understanding of the item and would not be ready to include it in a sprint.
    For this reason, many Scrum teams include the existence of clear acceptance criteria as an item on their definition-of-ready checklist (see Chapter 6).

    <...>

    The team must also decide when to test all of the browsers.
    Each nonfunctional requirement is a prime target for inclusion in the team‚Äôs definition of done.
    If the team includes the ‚ÄúWeb Browser Support‚Äù nonfunctional requirement in the definition of done, the team will have to test any new features added in the sprint with all of the listed browsers.
    If it doesn‚Äôt work with all of them, the story isn‚Äôt done.

    I recommend that teams try to include as many of the nonfunctional requirements in their definitions of done as they possibly can.
    Waiting to test nonfunctional requirements until late in the development effort defers getting fast feedback on critical system performance characteristics.

    <...>

    nonfunctional requirement.
    1. A requirement that does not relate to functionality but to attributes such as reliability, efficiency, usability, maintainability, and portability, which product backlog items must possess in order to be fully accepted by the stakeholders.
    2. **Each nonfunctional requirement is a candidate for inclusion in the definition of done**. See also definition of done."
