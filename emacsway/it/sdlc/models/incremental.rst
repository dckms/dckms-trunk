    üìù "The \"incremental development\" model includes initial planning, initial requirements analysis, initial architectural definition, and initial validation, but allocates design, implementation, verification (and sometimes delivery) activities to a series of stages, each of which provides a portion of the intended functionality.
    The approach provides for some flexibility to respond to inaccurate cost or schedule estimates by moving functionality to later increments."
