    üí¨ "Scrum projects do not have an up-front analysis or design phase; all work occurs within the repeated cycle of sprints.
    This does not mean, however, that design on a Scrum project is not intentional.
    An intentional design process is one in which the design is guided through deliberate, conscious decision making.
    The difference on a Scrum project is not that intentional design is thrown out, but that it is done (like everything else on a Scrum project) incrementally.
    Scrum teams acknowledge that as nice as it might be to make all design decisions up front, doing so is impossible.
    This means that on a Scrum project, design is both intentional and emergent.

    A big part of an organization's becoming agile is finding the appropriate balance between anticipation and adaptation (Highsmith 2002).
    Figure 9.2 shows this balance along with activities and artifacts that influence the balance.
    When doing up-front analysis or design, we are attempting to anticipate users' needs.
    Because we cannot perfectly anticipate these, we will make some mistakes; some work will need to be redone.
    When we forgo analysis and design and jump immediately into coding and testing with no forethought at all, we are trying to adapt to users' needs.
    All projects of interest will be positioned somewhere between anticipation and adaptation based on their own unique characteristics; no application will be all the way to either extreme.
    A life-critical, medical safety application may be far to the anticipation side.
    A three-person startup company building a website of information on kayak racing may be far toward the side of adaptation.

    Foretelling the agile preference for simplicity, in 1990, was speaker and author Do-While Jones. 

        I'm not against planning for the future.
        Some thought should be given to future expansion of capability.
        But when the entire design process gets bogged down in an attempt to satisfy future requirements that may never materialize, then it is time to stop and see if there isn't a simpler way to solve the immediate problem.

        -- Jones' 1990 article, "The Breakfast Food Cooker," remains a classic parable of what can go wrong when software developers over-design a solution. I highly recommended reading it at http://www.ridgecrest.ca.us/~do_while/toaster.htm

    Scrum teams avoid this "bogging down" by realizing that not all future needs are worth worrying about today. Many future needs may be best handled by planning to adapt as they arise."

    üí¨ McConnell writes, "In ten years the pendulum has swung from 'design everything' to 'design nothing.'
    But the alternative to BDUF [Big Design Up Front] isn't no design up front, it's a Little Design Up Front (LDUF) or Enough Design Up Front (ENUF)."
    This is a strawman argument.
    The alternative to designing before implementing is designing after implementing.
    Some design up-front is necessary, but just enough to get the initial implementation.
    Further design takes place once the implementation is in place and the real constraints on the design are obvious.
    Far from "design nothing," the XP strategy is "design always."

    üí¨ "From the very earliest days of agile methods, people have asked what role there is for architectural or design thinking.
    A common misconception is that since agile methods drop the notion of a detailed up-front design artifact, that there is no room for architecture in an agile project.
    In my keynote at the first-ever agile conference, I pointed out that design was every bit as important for agile projects, but it manifests itself differently, becoming an evolutionary approach."

    -- "`Agile Software Development <https://martinfowler.com/agile.html>`__" by Martin Fowler

..

    üí¨ "Though BDUF is an Agile anti-pattern, does it mean architecture should solely be a product from emergence? As James Coplien argues [Coplien 2010], some intentional architecture saves waste and accelerates the decision process.

    Agile Architecture shall seek a balance between intentional and emerging. Intentional architecture provides value if it is done differently. Intentional architecture represents a set of assumptions that must be verified. It should not slow down the integration of new requirements.

..

    üí¨ "The incremental and iterative nature of Agile development can facilitate efficient technical and management processes and practices to reduce the cost associated with change.
    In comparison, projects managed at the waterfall end of the continuum seek to reduce total rework cost by minimizing the number of changes, limiting the number of control points, and baselining detailed specifications which are reviewed and traced throughout the project."

    -- "ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 Systems and software engineering - Software life cycle processes"

..

    üí¨ "Agile" methods actually can be applied within a variety of models.
    While Agile methods are common in executing an evolutionary lifecycle model, they can be used in other lifecycle models at various stages.
    What the methods have in common is an emphasis on continuous inspection and collaboration in the rapid production of working software in an environment where changes, including changes to requirements, are expected.

    -- "ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 Systems and software engineering - Software life cycle processes"

    üí¨ Waterfalls and iterations may nest inside each other.
    A six year project might consist of two 3 year projects, where each of the two projects are structured in a waterfall style, but the second project adds additional features.
    You can think of this as a two-iteration project at the top level with each iteration as a waterfall. Due to the large size and small number of iterations, I'd regard that as primarily a waterfall projecta
    In contrast you might see a project with 16 iterations of one month each, where each iteration is planned in a waterfall style.
    That I'd see as primarily iterative.
    While in theory there's potential for a middle ground projects that are hard to classify, in practice it's usually easy to tell that one style predominates.

    üí¨ "One trade-off that's often overlooked is between the number of options you have and the resulting complexity. More options are desirable, but wanting to have all options all the time will result in unnecessary complexity, as is often the case with overly elaborate abstraction layers or massive configuration frameworks. I captured this effect into Gregor's Law:

        Excessive complexity is nature's punishment for organizations that are unable to make decisions."

..

    üí¨ "If you pick any one aspect of software then you can make it easy to change, but we don't know how to make everything easy to change. Making something easy to change makes the overall system a little more complex, and making everything easy to change makes the entire system very complex. Complexity is what makes software hard to change. That, and duplication."

–í 2000-–º Tom DeMarco –∏ Camden, Maine –ø–∏—Å–∞–ª–∏:

    üí¨ "In On War, Carl von Clausewitz tells us that military history is a pendulum swinging back and forth between the relative advantages of armor and of mobility.
    The knights in shining armor were able to dominate any knight without, but they were no match for the quick, nearly naked pony warriors that swept across the plains with Genghis Kahn and his Mongols.
    Light cavalry itself was doomed as soon as there were tanks, and tanks were no match for fleet-footed Palestinian teenagers with Sagger missiles.
    With the Maginot Line, the French were gambling that the pendulum had swung again toward armor, but it hadn't, and the Germans simply went around it.

    In the field of IT, we are just emerging from a time in which armor (process) has been king.
    And now we are moving into a time when only mobility matters.
    Building a product the right way still sounds like a laudable goal, but‚Äîlet's face it‚Äîwhat really matters today is building it fast.
    Because we are process-obsessed in our field, we have tended to react to this new imperative as we reacted to the imperatives thrust upon us in the 1980s and 1990s.
    We have asked, "What shall we add to our process to deal with this new situation?"

    Both architecture and agile methods thrive under high levels of uncertainty!
    And isn't that exactly the environment we mostly face today with rapid changes in technology and short-lived business models?

    üí¨Ô∏è "Grady Booch has also provided a set of guidelines for an agile architecture (which in turn imply some duties for the agile architect).
    Booch claims that all good software-intensive architectures are agile.
    What does he mean by this? He means that a successful architecture is resilient and loosely coupled.
    It is composed of a core set of well-reasoned design decisions but still contains some \"wiggle room\" that allows modifications to be made and refactorings to be done, without ruining the original structure.

    Booch also notes that an effective agile process will allow the architecture to grow incrementally as the system is developed and matures.
    The key to success is to have decomposability, separation of concerns, and near-independence of the parts.
    (Sound familiar? These are all modifiability tactics.)

    Finally, Booch notes that to be agile, the architecture should be visible and self-evident in the code; this means making the design patterns, cross-cutting concerns, and other important decisions obvious, well communicated, and defended.
    This may, in turn, require documentation.
    But whatever architectural decisions are made, the architect must make an effort to \"socialize\" the architecture."

    üí¨ "For example, I think that ultimately, Extreme Programming has mushroomed in use and interest, not because of pair-programming or refactoring, but because, taken as a whole, the practices define a developer community freed from the baggage of Dilbertesque corporations.
    Kent Beck tells the story of an early job in which he estimated a programming effort of six weeks for two people.
    After his manager reassigned the other programmer at the beginning of the project, he completed the project in twelve weeks‚Äîand felt terrible about himself!
    The boss‚Äîof course‚Äîharangued Kent about how slow he was throughout the second six weeks.
    **Kent, somewhat despondent because he was such a \"failure\" as a programmer, finally realized that his original estimate of 6 weeks was extremely accurate‚Äîfor 2 people‚Äîand that his \"failure\" was really the manager's failure, indeed, the failure of the standard \"fixed\" process mindset that so frequently plagues our industry.**

    **This type of situation goes on every day‚Äîmarketing, or management, or external customers, internal customers, and, yes, even developers ‚Äî don't want to make hard trade-off decisions, so they impose irrational demands through the imposition of corporate power structures.**
    This isn't merely a software development problem, it runs throughout Dilbertesque organizations.

    **In order to succeed in the new economy, to move aggressively into the era of e-business, e-commerce, and the web, companies have to rid themselves of their Dilbert manifestations of make-work and arcane policies.**
    This freedom from the inanities of corporate life attracts proponents of Agile Methodologies, and scares the begeebers (you can't use the word 'shit' in a professional paper) out of traditionalists.
    Quite frankly, the Agile approaches scare corporate bureaucrats ‚Äî at least those that are happy pushing process for process' sake versus trying to do the best for the \"customer\" and deliver something timely and tangible and \"as promised\" ‚Äî because they run out of places to hide.

    **The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact, many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology.**
    **We want to restore a balance.**
    **We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository.**
    **We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes.**
    **We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment.**
    Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as \"hackers\" are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker."

    üí¨ "...iterative development is expensive. It is the best approach for developing software in very complex, and lean-demanding domains. However, the initial starting point matters, a lot. A big refactoring will cost a lot more than iterative fine tuning (think splitting a database, vs renaming a variable). So I'll do everything possible to start iterating from the most reasonable starting point."
