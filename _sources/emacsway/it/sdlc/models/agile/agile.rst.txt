    üìù "Agile development - software development approach based on :ref:`iterative development <emacsway-iterative-development>`, frequent inspection and adaptation, and incremental deliveries, in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration in cross‚Äêfunctional teams and through continual stakeholder feedback."

    -- "ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 Systems and software engineering - Software life cycle processes"

..

    üìù ""Agile" methods actually can be applied within a variety of models.
    While Agile methods are common in executing an evolutionary lifecycle model, they can be used in other lifecycle models at various stages.
    What the methods have in common is an emphasis on continuous inspection and collaboration in the rapid production of working software in an environment where changes, including changes to requirements, are expected."

    -- "ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 Systems and software engineering - Software life cycle processes"

..

    üìù "As discussed in 5.4.2, the life cycle models used in agile projects are often highly :ref:`incremental <emacsway-incremental-development>` and :ref:`evolutionary <emacsway-evolutionary-development>`."

    üìù "What would we do if all that investment paid off?
    What if all that work on languages and databases and whatnot actually got somewhere?
    What if the cost of change didn't rise exponentially overtime, but rose much more slowly, **eventually reaching an asymptote**?
    What if tomorrow's software engineering professor draws Figure 3 on the board?"

    üìù "At the core of understanding this argument is the software change curve.
    The change curve says that as the project runs, it becomes exponentially more expensive to make changes.
    The change curve is usually expressed in terms of phases "a change made in analysis for $1 would cost thousands to fix in production".
    This is ironic as most projects still work in an ad-hoc process that doesn't have an analysis phase, but the exponentiation is still there.
    **The exponential change curve means that evolutionary design cannot possibly work.**
    It also conveys why planned design must be done carefully because any mistakes in planned design face the same exponentiation.

    **The fundamental assumption underlying XP is that it is possible to flatten the change curve enough to make evolutionary design work.**
    This flattening is both enabled by XP and exploited by XP.
    This is part of the coupling of the XP practices: specifically **you can't do those parts of XP that exploit the flattened curve without doing those things that enable the flattening.**
    This is a common source of the controversy over XP.
    Many people criticize the exploitation without understanding the enabling.
    Often the criticisms stem from critics' own experience where they didn't do the enabling practices that allow the exploiting practices to work.
    As a result they got burned and when they see XP they remember the fire."

    -- "`Is Design Dead? <https://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html>`__" by M.Fowler

..

    üìù "**This is one of the premises of XP. It is the technical premise of XP.**
    If the cost of change rose slowly over time, you would act completely differently from how you do under the assumption that costs rise exponentially.
    You would make big decisions as late in the process as possible, to defer the cost of making the decisions and to have the greatest possible chance that they would be right.
    You would only implement what you had to, in hopes that the needs you anticipate for tomorrow wouldn't come true.
    You would introduce elements to the design only as they simplified existing code or made writing the next bit of code simpler.

    **If a flattened change cost curve makes XP possible, a steep change cost curve makes XP impossible.**
    If change is ruinously expensive, you would be crazy to charge ahead without careful forethought.
    But if change stays cheap, the additional value and reduced risk of early concrete feedback outweighs the additional cost of early change."

    üìù "The incremental and iterative nature of Agile development can facilitate **efficient technical and management processes and practices to reduce the cost associated with change**.
    In comparison, projects managed at the waterfall end of the continuum seek to reduce total rework cost by minimizing the number of changes, limiting the number of control points, and baselining detailed specifications which are reviewed and traced throughout the project."

    XP was one of the first agile methods, indeed XP was the dominant agile method in the late 90s and early 00s before Scrum became dominant as the noughties passed.

    üìù "One pattern I see time and time again on software teams is that they adopt Scrum, pay little attention to technical practices, and they're able to consistently increase their velocity for the first few years.
    But after about three or four years the technical debt they've accumulated in their code is so great that their velocity starts to grind to a halt and they find it difficult to even get simple features implemented.
    This is a place you do not want to get to, though I see it far too often in the software community‚Äîteams stuck there without a clue how to get out."

    I learned from Jeff Sutherland that the first Scrum actually did all the XP practices.
    But Ken Schwaber convinced him to leave the engineering practices out of Scrum, to keep the model simple and let the teams take responsibility for the tech practices themselves.
    Perhaps this helped spread Scrum faster, but the downside is that a lot of teams suffer because they lack the technical practices that enable sustainable agile development."

    üìù "To make agile work, you need solid technical practices.
    A lot of agile education under-emphasizes these, but if you skimp on this you won't gain the productivity and responsiveness benefits that agile development can give you (stranding you at level 1 of the agile fluency model.)
    This is one of the reasons that I still think that Extreme Programming is the most valuable of the named agile methods as a core and starting point."

    üìù "In its common usage, evolutionary design is a disaster.
    The design ends up being the aggregation of a bunch of ad-hoc tactical decisions, each of which makes the code harder to alter.
    In many ways you might argue this is no design, certainly it usually leads to a poor design.
    As Kent puts it, **design is there to enable you to keep changing the software easily in the long term.**
    **As design deteriorates, so does your ability to make changes effectively.**
    You have the state of software entropy, over time the design gets worse and worse.
    Not only does this make the software harder to change, it also makes bugs both easier to breed and harder to find and safely kill.
    This is the "code and fix" nightmare, where the bugs become exponentially more expensive to fix as the project goes on."

    üìù "Grady Booch has also provided a set of guidelines for an agile architecture (which in turn imply some duties for the agile architect).
    Booch claims that all good software-intensive architectures are agile.
    What does he mean by this? He means that a successful architecture is resilient and loosely coupled.
    It is composed of a core set of well-reasoned design decisions but still contains some "wiggle room" that allows modifications to be made and refactorings to be done, without ruining the original structure.

    Booch also notes that an effective agile process will allow the architecture to grow incrementally as the system is developed and matures.
    The key to success is to have decomposability, separation of concerns, and near-independence of the parts.
    (Sound familiar? These are all modifiability tactics.)

    Finally, Booch notes that to be agile, the architecture should be visible and self-evident in the code; this means making the design patterns, cross-cutting concerns, and other important decisions obvious, well communicated, and defended.
    This may, in turn, require documentation.
    But whatever architectural decisions are made, the architect must make an effort to "socialize" the architecture."
